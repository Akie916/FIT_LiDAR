1. Download Data
2. Thinning + Denoise
  + influence of slope on point density?
  + optional: Compare their classification to one we make by ourselves
3. Create a DTM and a slope raster from that
4. Create a DSM
  + vary pixel sizes for DSM generation and compare to one "standard" pixel size
5. Tree top identification based on DSM with and without prior normalization
  + optional: try different algorithms for that
6. Tree crown delineation with and without prior normalization
7. Optional: check out C++ algorithm
